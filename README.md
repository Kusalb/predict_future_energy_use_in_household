# predict_future_energy_use_in_household
This project constructs and evaluates prediction models for energy use in a low-energy house using a energy dataset. Data dependencies are analyzed, preprocessing techniques applied, and at least two models implemented. The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics.
